## Project Task app

### Tech used

<ul>
  <li>java</li>
  <li>spring boot</li>
  <li>React js</li>
  <li>Typescript</>
  <li>Postgresql</li>
</ul>


### I haved used MVC architecture in backend to develop the apis . We have a model called Task  and few api end points that lets you do crud opearions in this model and the app is hosted in railway.app , front end is powered by react and typescript hosted in vercel.com

## Thought process

### I started by creating a standerd spring boot app and used documentaion , chat gpt , anthropic cluadia etc to develop the program i was stuck in jpm for few hours becuause of some error in depedency injection , i was able to solve that and inorder to make the response better i created a response class and did method overriding and made the class type compatble by using the generics . developing the frontend was easier for me since i have been working in react for few years i was able to create the frontend in few hours , i used typescript for better dx and vanila css

### for local development i used postgresql running inside a docker container as the database

* This is the first time i am writing spring boot application  , i have experience in writinf nest js so this method of programming with decorators was familar for me
